# ChessGame
A custom chess game that uses Tkinter to visualize a chess board.

Make sure that the "home" location in the python venv/pyvenv.cfg is set to the base interpreter for python. 
1) Open anaconda prompt and type in "where python"
2) Open the venv/pyvenv.cfg file with notepad
2) Copy the return of 1) after the "home" keyword. For me the file looks like this:

home = C:\Users\tijme\AppData\Local\Continuum\anaconda3
include-system-site-packages = false
version = 3.7.1
